# D2QOL | Crafting

Items in orange are crafted items.

**Generally, you only ever want to craft boots, belts, gloves, rings, and amulets.**

## 3-4 Fixed Properties

Each Crafted Item has one or more fixed properties. For example, there are some Crafted Items guaranteed to have from 5-10% Chance of Crushing Blow. Often the Fixed Properties are not available normally on Magic or Rare Items. It's also nice to be able to create an item knowing which fixed magical bonuses are going to always appear which is not the case with Magic or Rare Items.

## 1-4 Random Prefixes/Suffixes

On top of those fixed properties, a Crafted Item can have from 1-4 standard Rare and Magic Prefix and Suffixes. These are generated pretty much the same way as a Rare item.

- At ilvls 1-30, there's a 40% chance of 1 affix and a 20% chance each of 2, 3 or 4 affixes.
- At ilvls 31-50, there's a 60% chance of 2 affixes and a 20% chance each of 3 or 4 affixes.
- At ilvls 51-70, there's an 80% chance of 3 affixes and a 20% chance of 4 affixes.
- At ilvls 71+, there's a 100% chance of 4 affixes.
