## Install

- Purchase keys from [Blizzard](https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/family/diablo-ii).
- Install [Diablo II](https://mega.nz/#!e9thyD6A!ExGJuZUtvRJ2c8DrxSL0ihCouh-ARbdVxODXIqVt3dc) - ``v1.13d``
- Download this [zipfile](https://github.com/whipowill/d2-plugy-qol/archive/master.zip) and merge the files into your D2 install directory.
- Consult this [guide](https://github.com/whipowill/d2-plugy-qol/blob/master/Guides/Video.md) to configure your video settings.
- Make a ``Game.exe`` shortcut on your desktop w/ modifications:
	- If using ``DDraw`` set target to ``"C:\Games\Diablo II\Game.exe" -direct -txt``.
	- If using ``Glide`` set target to ``"C:\Games\Diablo II\Game.exe" -3dfx -direct -txt``.
- Launch the game by running the shortcut you made.
- Modify the loot filter settings by clicking the ``BH`` button ingame.

### Mac/Linux

You can successfully install the game on Mac and Linux but you will have to use Wine in order to do it.  It's more advanced and requires the use of Terminal.  I've written a [guide](https://github.com/whipowill/d2-plugy-qol/blob/master/Guides/Unix.md) on how to do this.

### Uninstall

Delete all the files you merged through this install process and copy the files from ``Backups`` into your ``C:\Games\Diablo II\`` folder.

## Soft Mods

Included in this [folder](https://github.com/whipowill/d2-plugy-qol/tree/master/Diablo%20II/Data/global/excel) are several "soft mods" that are popular in the D2 community.  While these days I prefer a purist D2 experience, these mods can be pretty fun and I've played them all.

These mods are separated into individual folders so you can pick and choose what you want.  None of these mods are turned on by default in this QOL modpack, you have to turn them on yourself.

To install any of these, just copy and paste the contents of the folder into the parent directory.  So the ``TXT`` files are going to end up in ``C:\Games\Diablo II\Data\Global\Excel\``.

## Loot Filter

Clicking the ``BH`` button in game will bring up the menu of options.

### Filter Level

This controls what items show up on the ground as drops.

- ``Off`` - No filters.
- ``Minimal`` - Filters white items.
- ``Moderate`` - Filters white and blue items.
- ``Aggressive`` - Filters white, blue, and yellow items.

No matter what filter level you choose runes, charms, jewels, gems, rings, amulets, set items, unique items, and eligable socketable items are never filtered out.

### Ping Level

This controls what items are printed into the chat as an alert.

- ``0`` - No alerts.
- ``1`` - Alert all unique and set items.
- ``2`` - Alert all the above, plus eligable base items.
- ``3`` - Alert all the above, plus charms.
- ``4`` - Alert all the above, plus rings + ammys.
- ``5`` - Alert all the above, plus jewels.
- ``6`` - Alert all the above, plus gems.

This feature is super handy bc it means you can slaughter demons in the game without having to check the floor every 2 seconds to see what dropped.

## Keyboard Macros

This game is very clicky and you can quickly develop carpal tunnel syndrome.  To avoid this I wrote a [keyboard macro](https://github.com/whipowill/ahk-autoattack) that lets you hold down ``spacebar`` to move and attack.  This makes melee characters a lot easier to play.
